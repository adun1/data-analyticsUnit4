## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# athleteData <- read.csv(file = "data/Athletes.csv")
pokemonData <- read.csv(file = "data/pokemon.csv")

#debugging
colnames(pokemonData)
head(pokemonData)

# ggplot(data = pokemonData, mapping = aes(x = Defense, )) + geom_histogram()

#histogram of hp
ggplot(data = pokemonData, mapping = aes(x = HP, fill = Primary.Type)) + geom_histogram()

#dot plot of hp according to pokemon type
ggplot(data = pokemonData, mapping = aes(x = HP, group = Primary.Type, fill = Primary.Type, )) + geom_dotplot(binwidth = NULL) + facet_wrap(~Primary.Type)





# colnames(athleteData)
# head(athleteData)
# 
# sr <- order(athleteData, decreasing = FALSE)
# #sr
# 
# #ggplot2::ggplot(data = athleteData, mapping = aes(x = NOC)) + geom_histogram()
# ggplot(data = athleteData[sr,], mapping = aes(x = NOC), fill = Discipline) + geom_bar()
```
